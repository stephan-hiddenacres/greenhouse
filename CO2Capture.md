Designing a DIY CO2 capture system that stores CO2 at night and releases it during the day, triggered by sunlight, can be done using simple materials and leveraging natural chemical reactions or low-energy mechanical systems. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how you might approach this:

1. Concept Overview
Capture CO2 at Night: The goal is to trap CO2 generated at night, when plants are not photosynthesizing. This CO2 can come from natural processes like composting, respiration, or small biomass sources.
Release CO2 in the Daylight: The captured CO2 would be released into the greenhouse during the day when plants are actively photosynthesizing and using CO2 to fuel growth.
Sunlight as a Trigger: Use sunlight to either heat the CO2 storage medium or trigger a valve to release stored CO2.
2. CO2 Capture Methods
A. Activated Carbon or Chemical Scrubber
How it works: Activated carbon is porous and can absorb CO2, releasing it when heated. You can build a simple DIY system using activated carbon in a filter-like setup.
Materials: Activated carbon (easily available), airtight container, and tubing.
Capture Process: At night, air rich in CO2 is drawn through the activated carbon, which absorbs the CO2. You can do this passively using natural airflow or with a small fan.
Release Process: During the day, solar heating (using a solar collector or reflective surfaces) heats the container, causing the activated carbon to release the stored CO2 into the greenhouse. A thermally activated valve could control the release process.
B. Sodium Hydroxide Solution
How it works: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacts with CO2 to form sodium carbonate. The CO2 can then be released when exposed to heat.
Capture Process: Create a simple solution of NaOH in water. As air passes over the solution, CO2 is absorbed and converted into sodium carbonate.
Release Process: During the day, the solution can be heated using solar energy, which decomposes the sodium carbonate back into CO2, releasing it into the greenhouse.
C. Biogas Capture (Anaerobic Digestion)
How it works: Biogas systems use organic material (manure, compost, food waste) to produce CO2 and methane. You can capture the CO2 from this process and store it in a sealed container.
Capture Process: Use a simple biogas digester (airtight container with organic material breaking down anaerobically). As the material decomposes, CO2 is naturally produced. The gas is collected and stored in a balloon or gas bag.
Release Process: During the day, the stored gas is passively released via a valve or through heating the storage system (e.g., a black container placed in sunlight) to raise pressure, causing the CO2 to flow into the greenhouse.
3. Sunlight Activation Mechanisms
A. Thermal Expansion Valve
How it works: You can use a simple thermally activated valve (also called a thermal actuator) that opens when exposed to heat from sunlight.
Setup: Install a valve between the CO2 storage container and the greenhouse. During the night, the valve stays closed. In the daytime, sunlight heats the actuator, opening the valve to release CO2.
DIY Options: Use off-the-shelf thermal actuators used in greenhouses for automatic window openers, which can be repurposed for your CO2 system.
B. Solar-Powered Fan System
How it works: Instead of relying on thermal expansion, you can use a small solar panel to power a fan or pump that releases CO2 when the sun is out.
Setup: The solar panel powers the fan during daylight, pulling CO2 from the storage container and releasing it into the greenhouse. At night, the system naturally shuts off when there's no sunlight.
Cost: This is a low-cost, low-energy system since it only operates when solar power is available.
4. Storage Medium for CO2
A. Gas Bags or Balloons
How it works: CO2 can be captured and stored in gas bags or large balloons (biogas storage bags, which are relatively inexpensive).
Capture Process: Connect the gas bag to your CO2 capture system (e.g., biogas digester or activated carbon filter).
Release Process: The CO2 bag can be connected to a valve system or a solar-activated fan to release CO2 during the day. As the sun heats the gas bag, pressure builds up, naturally pushing CO2 into the greenhouse.
B. Chemical Storage (Reversible Reactions)
How it works: Use a chemical solution that absorbs CO2 at night and releases it when heated.
Examples: Calcium hydroxide can be used to absorb CO2, creating calcium carbonate. When heated, the reaction is reversed, releasing CO2.
Setup: Set up containers with a chemical solution in your greenhouse. During the night, the solution absorbs CO2, and during the day, solar heating triggers the release.
5. Oxygen Harvesting for Sleeping Quarters
In addition to capturing CO2, your greenhouse will naturally produce oxygen through photosynthesis during daylight hours. To harvest this oxygen for use in your sleeping quarters:

Fan System: Use a solar-powered fan to direct oxygen-rich air from the greenhouse into your sleeping quarters during the night.
Air Quality Sensors: Integrate air quality sensors with Node-RED and set up an automation that controls the fan based on oxygen levels in your sleeping space.

Summary of Key Steps:
Capture CO2 at night using an activated carbon filter, biogas digester, or chemical scrubber.
Store CO2 in a gas bag or chemical medium.
Use solar heating or a solar-powered fan to release CO2 during the day when plants need it most.
Optionally, harvest the oxygen generated by plants during the day for use in your sleeping quarters at night.
This approach can be set up affordably and scaled depending on the size of your greenhouse and the amount of CO2 you want to capture. Let me know if you'd like help with specific components or design details!
