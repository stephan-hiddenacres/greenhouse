Here is a summary of what we've discussed regarding DC distribution and sensor configurations for your greenhouse monitoring and automation project:

1. DC Power Distribution for Sensors in the Greenhouse
You are planning to design a DC power distribution system to ensure continuity during power outages and facilitate modular connections for each sensor setup. Here’s what we've discussed:

DC Power Distribution Key Points:
UPS Integration: The DC power system will be connected to a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to keep your greenhouse monitoring systems operational during power outages.
Modular Design: The system should have modular connectors for each sensor, allowing you to easily plug and unplug sensors as needed. This could involve standardized DC barrel connectors or similar connections.
Voltage: Ensure that the distribution system provides the correct voltage for your sensors, typically 5V or 12V depending on the sensor type. You can use DC-to-DC converters to step down or up the voltage as needed.
Wiring and Layout: The wiring should be neat, organized, and allow for easy expansion as you add more sensors to the greenhouse. Running cables through conduit or cable management trays will help keep things organized.
Backup Power: A battery backup system will ensure the DC system remains operational even when grid power is down. You can monitor the UPS’s battery life with Node-RED or similar systems to trigger alerts when the battery is low.
2. Sensor Configuration for Greenhouse Monitoring and Automation
You plan to use a variety of sensors for monitoring environmental conditions in the greenhouse and automate systems for optimal plant growth. Here are the key sensor types and configurations we've discussed:

Key Sensors:
Temperature Sensors:

Type: DS18B20 or DHT22 sensors for measuring air temperature.
Configuration: Position sensors in various zones of the greenhouse to monitor temperature fluctuations.
Automation: Use Node-RED to trigger ventilation fans or heating systems when temperatures exceed predefined limits.
Humidity Sensors:

Type: DHT22 or AM2302 for relative humidity.
Placement: Distributed evenly across the greenhouse, especially in sensitive zones like the mushroom-growing area.
Automation: Control humidifiers or dehumidifiers based on real-time data.
Soil Moisture Sensors:

Type: Capacitive soil moisture sensors for precise readings.
Use: Placed in each soil bed to monitor moisture levels.
Automation: Control irrigation systems based on soil moisture thresholds. Sensors can be linked to drip irrigation systems.
CO2 Sensors:

Type: MH-Z19 or similar CO2 sensors.
Placement: Distributed to monitor CO2 levels, especially during the day when plants require CO2 for photosynthesis.
Automation: Release captured CO2 into the greenhouse when levels fall below optimal thresholds.
Light Sensors (LDR or TSL2591):

Use: Monitor light intensity and quality in various greenhouse zones, ensuring plants receive adequate sunlight.
Automation: Control grow lights if natural light is insufficient, or use shading mechanisms during intense light.
Mushroom Environment Monitoring:

Sensors: Use temperature, humidity, and CO2 sensors specifically tuned for mushroom cultivation. These sensors need to be more sensitive to humidity fluctuations.
Automation: Control misting systems, fans, and CO2 release based on sensor input.
Data Integration and Automation:
Node-RED will be used as the primary automation platform to collect sensor data, analyze it in real-time, and trigger relevant actions such as turning on fans, opening vents, or activating misting systems.
InfluxDB is your preferred choice for storing long-term sensor data, which will be visualized using Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring.
Powering the Sensors:
All sensors will be powered by the DC distribution system mentioned earlier, ensuring they remain functional during outages.
Each sensor or group of sensors will be connected to the DC system through modular connectors for easy replacement and maintenance.
Conclusion:
This setup covers the power distribution needs and the sensor configuration to monitor key environmental factors in your greenhouse and automate actions through Node-RED. By integrating sensors for temperature, humidity, CO2, soil moisture, and light, you’ll have complete control over the growing conditions, ensuring optimal growth and efficiency.
